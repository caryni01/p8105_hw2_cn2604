# Problem 1

The primary variables of this dataset are the name and location of the
stations, their divisions and lines with different routes, the types of
entrance and their locations. Other additional information such as
presence of staffs, vending, ADA, and crossing over are also provided.

My **cleaning steps** are 1) Read the csv documents and clean the names
with janitor. 2) Convert *entry* variable to logical variable, *corner*,
*staffing*, *entrance_type*, and *division* to factor variables, and
convert *route8* to *route11* to character variables. 3) To make tidy
data by separating the variables of *route_name* and *route_number* with
pivot_longer function. 4) Combine the column of *station_name* and
*line* to *unique_station_name* as a mark the station.

This processed dataset has 20548 rows and 22 columns. Since the
variables of *route_name* and *route_number* are manipulated to make
each column a variable and each row an observation, data in this set are
now tidy.
